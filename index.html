          <div class="bio">
              <p>I’m all about taking on the challenges that the tech world throws my way. 
                With a Master’s degree in Computer and 
                Information Sciences, I bring a robust academic
                 foundation and an innovative mindset to each project..
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  In my professional journey, I've embraced the complexities of coding and 
                  technology, striving always to enhance functionality and user engagement
                   through thoughtful, effective solutions. My approach is 
                   holistic—believing that a coder should not only write clean code but 
                   also engage creatively and ethically with the technologies we shape and 
                   that shape us.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Beyond coding, I'm an explorer of life’s flavors and rhythms. 
                  Whether in the tranquility of my garden or the creative expression found in dance, 
                  I find balance 
                  and inspiration that fuel my professional creativity and resilience.
                </p>
                
                  <p> 
                    I'm here to collaborate, learn, and contribute to projects that seek not 
                    only to meet but exceed the expectations of the digital age. If you're 
                    looking for a partner in your next technological endeavor, I’d love to chat!
